🌿 **Plant Disease Detection using CNN & AI/ML**
A deep learning-based project that leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically detect and classify plant diseases from leaf images. This AI/ML solution aims to assist farmers and agricultural experts in early disease diagnosis, enabling timely intervention and improved crop health.

🔍 **Features**
1) Trained on a large dataset of healthy and diseased plant leaf images

2) Uses a CNN model for high-accuracy image classification

3) Real-time prediction support (via web/mobile integration optional)

4) Visualization of training metrics and confusion matrix

5) Supports multiple crop types (e.g., tomato, potato, maize)

🧠 **Technologies Used**
1) Python

2) TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch (choose one based on your implementation)

3) NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib

4) Scikit-learn for evaluation

5) (Optional) Flask/Streamlit for frontend deployment

📦 **Dataset**
PlantVillage Dataset or any custom dataset

🚀 **How to Use**
Clone the repo:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plant-disease-detection.git
cd plant-disease-detection
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Train the model:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train.py
Run predictions on new images:

bash
Copy
Edit
python predict.py --image path/to/leaf.jpg

📈 **Results**
Achieved over XX% accuracy on validation data with low false positives. Model performance improves with transfer learning and data augmentation.

🤖 **Future Work**
1) Integration with mobile camera apps

2) Expand dataset for more plant types and real-world variability

3) Deploy as an API for smart agriculture platforms
